# 🤖 **AI-Powered Safety System - Simple Explanation**

## **What is this project?**

This is a **smart safety system** that uses your computer's camera to watch for dangerous situations and automatically stop machines to prevent accidents. Think of it like a very smart security guard that never sleeps!

---

## **�� Main Purpose**

**The system does 3 important things:**
1. **👁️ Watches** - Uses your camera to see what's happening
2. **�� Thinks** - Uses AI to detect people and dangerous situations  
3. **🛡️ Protects** - Automatically stops machines when it sees danger

---

## **�� How it Works (Step by Step)**

### **Step 1: Camera Setup**
- Your computer's camera turns on
- It starts recording what it sees
- The video is saved to a file

### **Step 2: AI Detection**
- **YOLOv8** (the AI brain) analyzes each frame of video
- It looks for:
  - 👤 **People** (potential hazard)
  - 🪖 **No helmets** (safety violation)
  - 🏃 **Falls** (accident detection)

### **Step 3: Safety Logic**
- **If AI sees a person** → Machine stops automatically
- **If AI sees no danger** → Machine runs normally
- **All events are logged** with timestamps

### **Step 4: Web Dashboard**
- You can watch everything on your web browser
- See the recorded video with AI detection boxes
- Check machine status (running/stopped)
- View all safety events and logs

## **🚀 How to Use**

### **1. Start the Safety System**
```bash
python main.py
```
- Camera turns on
- AI starts watching
- Video recording begins
- Press 'q' to stop

### **2. View the Dashboard**
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```
- Open browser: **http://localhost:8501**
- See recorded video with AI detection
- Check machine status
- View safety logs

## **🎬 What You'll See**

### **In the Video:**
- **Green boxes** around detected objects
- **Red boxes** around people (hazards)
- **Text overlays** showing what AI detected
- **Machine status** (RUNNING/STOPPED)

### **In the Dashboard:**
- **�� Camera Feed Tab**: Watch recorded videos
- **⚙️ System Status Tab**: Check machine status
- **📋 Event Log Tab**: See all safety events

---

## **🔍 Key Features**

### **✅ What Works:**
- **Real-time person detection**
- **Automatic machine control**
- **Video recording with AI overlays**
- **Event logging and timestamps**
- **Beautiful web dashboard**
- **Download videos and logs**

### **🎯 Safety Scenarios:**
1. **Person enters danger zone** → Machine stops
2. **Person leaves danger zone** → Machine starts
3. **No helmet detected** → Machine stops
4. **All events logged** for safety records
